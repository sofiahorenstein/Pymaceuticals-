In this data analysis, I analyzed a data set of a recent animal study in which 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days and their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The goal of this data analysis is to screen for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. 

I analyzed the effects of four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) and: 

Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
Created a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
